Contact Management System Automation 
Project Objective

This project was initially created to automate the Thinking Tester Contact Management Web Application.
However, due to continuous connectivity issues and the site becoming unavailable, full automation could not be executed.

To complete the automation objectives and retain all planned scenarios (Login, Data Entry, Edit, Delete, Session management, UI validation), the project was migrated to a publicly stable web application:

 Demo Web Shop – http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/

This allowed successful execution of all equivalent test flows.
